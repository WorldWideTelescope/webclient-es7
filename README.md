# webclient-es7
A new temp repo to show work in progress as I convert the client code from angular, es5, webforms, and grunt to ES7, Vue, and webpack.

It is currently very much pre-alpha, but it will display an html5 sdk canvas and a ribbon. 

Not sure where the final version will live. This is temp to get my work in progress into git.

To run

Install yarn globally
npm i -g yarn

Install dependencies
yarn

run locally
yarn serve
